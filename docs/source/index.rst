Oasis Loss Modelling Framework (oasislmf)! HELLO
==========================================

The repository provides a Python toolkit for building, running and
testing Oasis models end-to-end, including performing individual steps
in this process. It includes:

-  an api client for interacting with the api server (in the
   ``api_client`` submodule)
-  a Python class framework for working with Oasis models and model
   resources as Python objects (the ``models`` submodule)
-  a Python class framework for managing model exposures and resources,
   and also for generating Oasis files from these (the ``exposures``
   submodule)
-  a Python factory class for instantiating keys lookup services for
   models, and generating and saving keys outputs from these lookup
   services (the ``keys`` submodule)
-  a command line interface for creating and testing models. App options
   can be found by running ``oasiscli --help``
